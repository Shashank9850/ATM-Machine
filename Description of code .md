# Python ATM Simulator
Developed a Python program for an ATM machine simulator, enabling functionalities such as balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, and deposit.

Process:
User Interface: The program presents a simple user interface that lists available transactions: balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, deposit, and exit.

Transaction Handling:
Balance Inquiry (Option 1): Displays the current balance.

Cash Withdrawal (Option 2): If the user chooses to withdraw cash, it prompts for the withdrawal amount. If the balance is sufficient, it deducts the withdrawal amount and updates the balance. Otherwise, it displays an insufficient balance message.

Deposit (Option 3): Prompts the user for the deposit amount and updates the balance accordingly.

Exit (Option 4): Terminates the program.

Error Handling: If the user enters an invalid option, it displays a message indicating that no transaction is selected.


Benefits:
Understanding of Basic Banking Operations: This project helps users understand the fundamental operations of an ATM machine, such as balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, and deposit.

Python Programming Practice: Implementing this ATM simulator provides practice in Python programming, including user input handling, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic operations.

Modularity and Readability: The code is relatively simple and easy to understand, making it suitable for beginners to comprehend and modify for learning purposes.

Real-World Application: While a simplified version, this project simulates real-world ATM functionalities, giving users a tangible application for their Python programming skills.

Customization Potential: The code can be extended and modified to include additional features such as PIN verification, transaction history, or user authentication, enhancing its complexity and educational value.
